3. **Verify Database**
   - Look for "student_management" in the left sidebar
   - Click on it to see the "students" table
   - Click on "students" to see 10 sample records

4. **Refresh Your Application**
   - Go to: http://localhost:8000/Assignment_13_MySQL_CRUD/
   - You should see:
     - ‚úÖ Statistics cards showing counts
     - ‚úÖ 10 student records in the table
     - ‚úÖ No console errors

### **Option 2: Using MySQL Command Line**

```bash

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Database connection failed"
**Solution:** Check `operations.php` line 9-12 for correct credentials:
```php
$host = 'localhost';
$username = 'root';
$password = '';  // Change if you have a password
$database = 'student_management';
```

### Problem: "Table doesn't exist"
**Solution:** Re-run `reset_database.sql` completely

### Problem: "Duplicate entry error"
**Solution:** The database wasn't properly dropped. Run this first:
```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS student_management;
```

## üìù Notes

- **All data will be deleted** when you run `reset_database.sql`
